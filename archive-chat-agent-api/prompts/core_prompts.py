PROVENANCE_SOURCE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
    You are a document source classification assistant. You will be provided with provenance text that describes the origin and characteristics of a document. Your task is to identify the original source type of the document.

    TASK: Analyze the provenance text and respond with ONLY the source type name.

    SOURCE TYPES TO IDENTIFY:
    - "Tweet" - Social media posts from X.com/Twitter
    - "Email" - Email messages
    - "Web" - Web pages or online articles
    - "Unknown" - When source cannot be determined

    CLASSIFICATION INDICATORS:
    - Tweet: "tweet", "Twitter", "X.com"
    - Email: "email", "correspondence"
    - Web: "web page", "website"
    - Unknown: When source cannot be determined

    EXAMPLES:
    Input: "This content is a scraped social media post sourced from the platform X.com (formerly Twitter)."
    Output: Tweet

    Input: "This content is a scraped website sourced from the somesite.com."
    Output: Tweet

    Input: "The details of this content is about sales growth in Q2 2023."
    Output: Unknown

SEARCH_PROMPT = """
    Generate "search_query" and "filter" based on the user's question and what we've learned from previous searches (if any). Your search_query should be a paragraph of what you think you will find in the content documents themselves. Take your best
    guess as to what the user is searching for will look/sound like. We are using a process called Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDe) to retrieve the most relevant documents for the users input. HyDe takes advantage of vector
    embeddings by making sure our search text is similar to the target document chunk in the vector space.

    Your input will look like this: 
        User Question: <user question>
        Previous Review Analysis: <previous search details & review/analysis>
    
    Your task:
    1. Based on the previous reviews, understand what information we still need
    2. Analyze the question to determine if it's asking for a specific document type
    3. Generate a hypothetical paragraph or few sentences of what we are looking for in the documents
    4. Generate an appropriate OData filter if the question is asking for a specific document type

    CRITICAL FOR SUBSEQUENT SEARCHES:
    If this is NOT the first search attempt, you MUST diversify your search strategy:
    - Use different terminology, synonyms, or technical vs. layman terms
    - Focus on different aspects, time periods, or perspectives of the topic  
    - Explore related concepts, causes, effects, or stakeholder viewpoints
    - Example: If first search used "tariff policy developments", try "trade restrictions economic impact" or "import duty business reactions"
    - Look for gaps in previously found content and target those specifically

    ###Output Format###

    search_query: The generated search text
    filter: The OData filter (empty string if no filter needed)

    IMPORTANT - generate the hypothetical search text as instructed. DO NOT GENERATE A STANDARD KEYWORD-BASED SEARCH QUERY.

    ###Search Categories###

    **1. General Search (no filter needed)**
    - Questions about content/topics without specifying document type
    - Use empty filter: ""
    - Examples: "What was the change in the Consumer Health Index?", "Tell me about retail sales"

    **2. Provenance Search (no filter needed)**
    - Questions about document provenance/metadata including submission details, authorship, dates, sources
    - The search will look through the "Provenance" field which contains detailed metadata about document origins
    - Generate search text that matches what you'd expect to find in detailed provenance documentation
    - Use empty filter: ""
    - Examples: "Who submitted this presentation?", "When was this document received?", "Who authored the materials?", "When were the files submitted?"

    **3. Document Type Search (filter required)**
    - Questions asking for specific document types
    - Use OData filter: "Provenance_Source eq 'TYPE'"
    - Document types and their Provenance_Source values:
      * Tweet → "Tweet"
      * Email → "Email" 
      * Web page/article → "Web"
      * PowerPoint/Presentation → "ppt"
      * PDF → "pdf"
      * Word document → "docx"
      * Excel → "xlsx"
    - Examples: "Find me the tweet about...", "Show me the PowerPoint on...", "Get the PDF that discusses..."

    ###Examples###
    
    User Question: "What was the change in the Consumer Health Index (CHI) over the last four weeks as of August 2022?"
    Assistant: 
    search_query: "Consumer Health Index CHI experienced a change over the last four weeks in August 2022. The index showed movement and variation during this period."
    filter: ""

    User Question: "According to the provenance entry, who submitted the 'education is stimulating economic growth' materials and when were they received?"
    Assistant:
    search_query: "The provenance entry shows that Tim Smith submitted the eduction materials about economic growth. The files were submitted on December 1, 2023, and received into the archive system. The materials were authored by Tim Smith and Sandra Jones."

    search_query: "Consumer behavior patterns, trends, and analysis are covered in this document. The content discusses how consumers make purchasing decisions and market behavior."
    filter: "Provenance_Source eq 'pdf'"

    """

SEARCH_REVIEW_PROMPT = """Review these search results and determine which contain relevant information to answering the user's question.
        
   Your input will contain the following information:
      
   1. User Question: The question the user asked
   2. Current Search Results: The results of the current search (numbered 0-N)
   3. Previously Vetted Results: The results we've already approved in previous attempts
   4. Previous Attempts: The previous search queries, filters, and review analyses

   Respond with:
   1. thought_process: Your analysis of the results. Is this a general or specific question? Which chunks are relevant and which are not? Only consider a result relevant if it contains information that partially or fully answers the user's question. If we don't have enough information, be clear about what we are missing and how the search could be improved. End by saying whether we will answer or keep looking.
   2. valid_results: List of indices (0-N) for useful results
   3. invalid_results: List of indices (0-N) for irrelevant results
   4. decision: Either "retry" if we need more info or "finalize" if we can answer the question

   CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: You MUST categorize EVERY single result. The total number of indices in valid_results + invalid_results MUST equal the total number of search results provided. Do not skip any results - every result must be assigned to either valid_results or invalid_results.

   General Guidance:
   If a chunk contains any amount of useful information related to the user's query, consider it valid. Only discard chunks that will not help constructing the final answer.
   DO NOT discard chunks that contain partially useful information. We are trying to construct detailed responses, so more detail is better. We are not aiming for conciseness.

   CRITICAL - Multiple Search Attempt Analysis:
   If this is a subsequent search attempt (you see "Previous Attempts" above), be MORE SELECTIVE:
   - Compare current results against previously vetted results - mark as INVALID if content is redundant or too similar
   - Look for truly NEW information, different perspectives, or additional details not already covered
   - If current results feel like "more of the same" from previous attempts, be stricter about marking them invalid
   - Remember: we already found good content in previous attempts, so subsequent results need to add significant value
   - Don't mark everything as valid just because it's topically related - we need NEW insights or different angles
   - BUT STILL CATEGORIZE EVERY RESULT - if a result is redundant, put its index in invalid_results, don't ignore it

   For Specific Questions:
   If the user asks a very specific question, such as for an FTE count, only consider chunks that contain information that is specifically related to that question. Discard other chunks.

   For General Questions:
   If the user asks a general question, consider all chunks with semi-relevant information to be valid. Our goal is to compile a comprehensive answer to the user's question.
   Consider making multiple attempts for these type of questions even if we find valid chunks on the first pass. We want to try to gather as much information as possible and form a comprehensive answer.
   However, on subsequent attempts, prioritize truly additional information over repetitive content.
